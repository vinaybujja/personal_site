                            <strong> Leonardo da Vinci, (Italian: “Leonardo from Vinci”) </strong>
                            (born April 15, 1452, Anchiano, near Vinci, Republic of Florence [Italy]—died May 2, 1519, Cloux [now Clos-Lucé], France), 
                            Italian painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer whose skill and intelligence, perhaps more than that of any other figure, 
                            epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. His Last Supper (1495–98) and Mona Lisa (c. 1503–19) are among the most widely popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance. 
                            His notebooks reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead of their time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The unique fame that Leonardo enjoyed in his lifetime and that, filtered by historical criticism, 
                            has remained undimmed to the present day rests largely on his unlimited desire for knowledge, 
                            which guided all his thinking and behaviour. An artist by disposition and endowment, 
                            he considered his eyes to be his main avenue to knowledge; 
                            to Leonardo, sight was man’s highest sense because it alone conveyed the facts of experience immediately, 
                            correctly, and with certainty. Hence, every phenomenon perceived became an object of knowledge, and saper vedere 
                            (“knowing how to see”) became the great theme of his studies. 
                            He applied his creativity to every realm in which graphic representation is used: he was a painter, sculptor, architect, and engineer. 
                            But he went even beyond that. He used his superb intellect, unusual powers of observation, and mastery of the art of drawing to study nature itself, 
                            a line of inquiry that allowed his dual pursuits of art and science to flourish.

                        <h2>Life and works</h2>
                        <h3>Early period: Florence</h3>
                        <p>
                            Leonardo’s parents were unmarried at the time of his birth. 
                            His father, Ser Piero, was a Florentine notary and landlord, and his mother, Caterina, was a young peasant woman who shortly thereafter married an artisan. 
                            Leonardo grew up on his father’s family’s estate, where he was treated as a “legitimate” son and received the usual elementary education of that day: reading, writing, and arithmetic. 
                            Leonardo did not seriously study Latin, the key language of traditional learning, until much later, when he acquired a working knowledge of it on his own. He also did not apply himself to higher mathematics—advanced geometry and arithmetic—until 
                            he was 30 years old, when he began to study it with diligent tenacity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leonardo’s artistic inclinations must have appeared early. When he was about 15, his father, who enjoyed a high reputation in the Florence community, apprenticed him to artist Andrea del Verrocchio. 
                            In Verrocchio’s renowned workshop Leonardo received a multifaceted training that included painting and sculpture as well as the technical-mechanical arts. 
                            He also worked in the next-door workshop of artist Antonio Pollaiuolo. In 1472 Leonardo was accepted into the painters’ guild of Florence, but he remained in his teacher’s workshop for five more years, after which time he worked independently in Florence until 1481. 
                            There are a great many superb extant pen and pencil drawings from this period, including many technical sketches—for example, pumps, military weapons, mechanical apparatus—that offer evidence of Leonardo’s interest in and knowledge of technical matters even at the outset of his career.

                        <h3>First Milanese period (1482–99)</h3>
                        <p>In 1482 Leonardo moved to Milan to work in the service of the city’s duke—a surprising step when one realizes that the 30-year-old artist had just received his first substantial commissions from his native city of Florence: the unfinished panel painting Adoration of the Magi for the monastery of San Donato a Scopeto and an altar painting for the St. Bernard Chapel in the Palazzo della Signoria, which was never begun. That he gave up both projects seems to indicate that he had deeper reasons for leaving Florence. It may have been that the rather sophisticated spirit of Neoplatonism prevailing in the Florence of the Medici went against the grain of Leonardo’s experience-oriented mind and that the more strict, academic atmosphere of Milan attracted him. Moreover, he was no doubt enticed by Duke Ludovico Sforza’s brilliant court and the meaningful projects awaiting him there.</p>
                        <p>Leonardo spent 17 years in Milan, until Ludovico’s fall from power in 1499. He was listed in the register of the royal household as pictor et ingeniarius ducalis (“painter and engineer of the duke”). Leonardo’s gracious but reserved personality and elegant bearing were well-received in court circles. Highly esteemed, he was constantly kept busy as a painter and sculptor and as a designer of court festivals. He was also frequently consulted as a technical adviser in the fields of architecture, fortifications, and military matters, and he served as a hydraulic and mechanical engineer. As he would throughout his life, Leonardo set boundless goals for himself; if one traces the outlines of his work for this period, or for his life as a whole, one is tempted to call it a grandiose “unfinished symphony.”</p>
